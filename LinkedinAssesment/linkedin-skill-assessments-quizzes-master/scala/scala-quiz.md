## Scala

#### Q1. Scala bytecode can run on top of Java VM. What is the fundamental difference between Java object.clone() and Scala object.copy()?

#### Q11. For the for-yield construct, is the scope separate between for-body and yield-body?

- [x] Yes and no. It is different depending on the for construct and what it does. NOT SURE
- [ ] Yes, because the for section does not expose its scope.
- [ ] No, because for-yield shares the same scope, even though they are within separate curly braces.

- [x] Yes, val does not make arrays immutable.
- [ ] No, val makes the array and values of the array immutable.
